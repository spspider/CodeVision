You can test these new versions of driver,
by using one of the language's .INF file.
The help files are missed, there is only a German and an English help file.
If you install any other language, the hardware wizard misses
the usb2lpt.hlp file. Choose either English (en) or German (de) help file.

The 64 bit drivers are bare functional, you can run
Kurzschlusstest.exe and Brenner.exe, but there is currently
no I/O redirecting.
As none of the drivers are signed, you must disable sign enforcement
for 64 bit systems (press F8 at Windows startup).
